The goal is to have a SPICE implementation in (mostly) native Python.\r\nThe benefits of a Python SPICE implementation are:\r\n* Simple integration with other programs and Python libraries\r\n* Modular, portable, and easily extensible\r\n* Intuitive Python syntax and program structure\r\n\r\n**Example plot:**\r\n\r\n![Plot](/images/fig1.png)\r\n\r\n**Example circuit description (netlist):**\r\n\r\n![Netlist](/images/netlist1.png)\r\n\r\n###How to Run PySpyce\r\n1. Download and extract the source code from one of the above links\r\n2. Simulate the test circuit by running example.py in the PySpyce folder\r\n\r\n###Project Dependences\r\nPySpyce requires the [SciPy Stack](http://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html), which is available as part of several scientific Python distributions such as [iPython](http://ipython.org/) and [Enthought Canapy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/). There are also SciPy Stack windows binaries available [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy-stack).\r\n\r\n\r\n###Current Capabilities\r\n* Basic circuit/subcircuit framework with high-level commands for building netlists\r\n* Basic level-0 components (R, L, C, V, D), including source stimuli and models.\r\n* Basic transient simulation and plotting capabilities\r\n\r\n###Next Steps\r\n* Complete level-0 versions of all atomic components and hide internal nodes\r\n* Implement n-level subcircuit nesting and circuit expansion algorithm\r\n* First-pass SPICE parser for importing SPICE *.cir files\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
